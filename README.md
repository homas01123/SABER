## Semi-Analytical Bayesian Error Retrieval (S.A.B.E.R.) Version 1.0

# Theoretical Background
 
SABER is a software developed in R to solve forward and inverse problems in different types of oceanic waters (CASE-I and CASE-II) as well as for inland waters by solving the Scalar Radiative Transfer Equation (SRTE) using Semi-analytical (SA) paramterizations. 

* FORWARD MODEL

The forward model calculates Remote-sensing reflectance ($R_\mathrm{rs}$) from user provided IOPs ($a$ & $b_\mathrm{b}$) or _in vivo_ Bio-geo-chemical (BGC) quantities; e.g. $[chl]$ (Bio-optical relationships are used to determine BGC component specific $a$ & $b_\mathrm{b}$) and viewing geometry. In case of shallow waters, where the benthic substrate has substantial upweling optical signal, the bottom depth ($H$) and benthic reflectance ($R_\mathrm{B}$) should also be supplied along with previously mentioned quantities. The forward model can be simply expressed as $R_\mathrm{rs}(\lambda)=f(a(\lambda),b_\mathrm{b}(\lambda),H, R_\mathrm{B}, \theta_\mathrm{v},\Delta\phi_\mathrm{v}, \theta_\mathrm{s})$ where, $a(\lambda)$ and $b_\mathrm{b}(\lambda)$ are absorption and backscatter varying with wavelength $\lambda$, $H$ is bottom depth, $R_\mathrm{B}$ is benthic reflectance, $\theta_\mathrm{v}$ is viewing zenith angle,  $\Delta\phi_\mathrm{v}$ is sensor viewing azimuth angle relative to the solar plane, and $\theta_\mathrm{s}$ is the solar zenith angle. 

 The forward model has two options for paramterization to simulate $R_\mathrm{rs}$, i.e. Albert & Mobley (2003) (AM03 onwards) and Lee et al. (1998) (L98 onwards) for both optically deep and shallow water types. However, currently, AM03 is implemented with a much greater support of bio-optical paramterizations for deriving spectral slopes and calculation of inelastic scattering (SICF and $f_\mathrm{DOM}$). Thus, it is recommended to users to use AM03 to perform forward simulations of SRTE. The AM03 forward model for elastic scattering part can be expressed as below:

$$R_{r s}^{e, m}(\lambda)=R_{r s, \infty} \cdot[1-\exp {-(K_d+\frac{K_{u, W}}{\cos \theta_v}) H}] + (\sum_{i=1}^n f_{a, i} B_i \cdot R_B) \cdot \exp {-(K_d+\frac{K_{u, B}}{\cos \theta_v}) H}$$

+ Where, $R_{r s, \infty}$ is the contribution from water column only (in deep waters, that is the only feasible component) which can be expressed as below:


$$R_{r s, \infty}=f^{\uparrow}\left(\omega_b, \theta_s, u, \theta_v\right) \cdot \omega_b=$$

$$f^{\uparrow}\left(\omega_b\right) \cdot f^{\uparrow}\left(\theta_s\right) \cdot f^{\uparrow}(u) \cdot f^{\uparrow}\left(\theta_v\right) \cdot \omega_b= \\
P_{r s, 1} \cdot\left(1+P_{r s, 2} \cdot \omega_b+P_{r s, 3} \cdot \omega_b^2+P_{r s, 4} \cdot \omega_b^3\right) \cdot\left(1+P_{r s, 5} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos \theta_s}\right) \cdot(1 \\
\left.+P_{r s, 6} \cdot u\right) \cdot\left(1+P_{r s, 7} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos \theta_v}\right) \cdot \omega_b$$

+ Where, $u$ is wind speed at water surface, $\omega_\mathrm{b}$ is the single-scattering albedo calculated as $\frac{b_\mathrm{b}}{a +b_\mathrm{b}}$ and $P_{r s, 1-7}$ are parametric coefficients. 

+ $K_\mathrm{d}$ and $K_\mathrm{u,W}$ and $K_\mathrm{u,B}$ are downwelling diffused attenuation coefficient and  as diffused attenuation coefficient for upwelling light from water column and bottom respectively. These are paramterized as below:


$$K_d=\kappa_0 \cdot \frac{a+b_b}{\cos \theta_s}, K_u=\left(a+b_b\right) \cdot\left(1+\omega_b\right)^{\kappa_i} \cdot\left(1+\kappa_2 \frac{1}{\cos \theta_s}\right)$$

+ Where, $\kappa_0$, $\kappa_i$ and $\kappa_2$ are parametric coefficients. Among rest, $f_\mathrm{a,i}$ is the areal fraction of $R_\mathrm{B}$ constrained up to five bottom types and $B_\mathrm{i}$ is the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) for each bottom type assumed to be lambertian ($\pi$).

The $a$ and $b_\mathrm{b}$ values can either be _in situ_ IOPs (processed following the IOCCG/NASA protocols) directly or in absence of _in situ_ IOPs, _in vivo_ values of $[chl]$, $a_\mathrm{CDOM}(443)$ and $a_\mathrm{NAP}(443)$ can be supplied to the forward model. In that case, the subsequent IOPs are calculated as following bio-optical parametrizations:

+ For phytoplankton absorption, $$a_\mathrm{\phi}(\lambda) = (a_\mathrm{0}(\lambda) + a_\mathrm{1}(\lambda) \ln[a_\mathrm{\phi}(443)]) \cdot a_\mathrm{\phi}(443)$$ 
Where, $a_\mathrm{\phi}(443) = 0.06[chl]^{0.65}$, $a_\mathrm{0}$ and $a_\mathrm{1}$ are precomputed parameters from Lee et al. (1994).

+ For coloured detrital matter absorption,
$$a_\mathrm{dg}(\lambda) = a_\mathrm{dg}(443)\exp {(-S_\mathrm{dg}(\lambda - 443))}$$
Where, $-S_\mathrm{dg}$ is the spectral slope which can be retrieved using QAA in deep waters as following:

$S_{\mathrm{dg}}=0.015+\left(\frac{0.002}{0.6+\frac{r_{\mathrm{rs}}(443)}{r_{r s}(555)}}\right)$ The $r_\mathrm{rs}$ is sub-surface Remote-sensing reflectance which can be calculated as $r_\mathrm{rs} = \frac{R_\mathrm{rs}}{0.52 + 1.7 \cdot R_\mathrm{rs}}$. In case of shallow water, a default value of 0.017 is used which can be changed by the user as well (For customization See Section "R-execution").

+ For particulate backscatter,
$$b_\mathrm{bp}(\lambda) = b_\mathrm{bp}(555){\left (\frac {\lambda}{555} \right)}^\eta$$
Where, $\eta$ is the spectral slope which can be retrieved using QAA in deep waters as following:

$\eta = 2.0 \left(1 - 1.2 \exp { \left( -0.9 \frac {r_\mathrm{rs}(443)} {r_\mathrm{rs}(555)}\right)}  \right)$. In case of shallow water, a default value of -0.46 is used which can be changed by the user as well (For customization See Section "R-execution").

The forward model also has support for simulation of inelastic scattering in water, i.e. Sun Induced Chlorophyll Fluoroscence (SICF) and CDOM Fluoroscence ($f_\mathrm{DOM}$). The SICF is calculated semi-analytically following the study by Gilerson et al. (2007) whereas the $f_\mathrm{DOM}$ is calculated analytically following Mobley (1994). 

+ SICF affects the wavelengths between 670-710 nm  $\lambda$ with a peak at $\sim 685$ nm. The SICF equivalent radiance at the peak SICF emission wavelength, 685nm, i.e. $L_\mathrm{\phi}(685)$ is calculated as,
$$L_\mathrm{\phi}(685) = \frac {0.092[chl]} {(1+0.40 a_\mathrm{dg}(443) + 0.078[chl])}$$. 
The spectral shape of SICF is modelled as summation of two Gaussian shape with $\mu = 685,730$ and $\sigma = 25,50$ as the Full Wave Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian curve: 

$$ hc(\lambda) = \sqrt{\frac{4 \ln 2}{\pi}} \frac{1}{25} \exp \left[-4 \ln 2\left(\frac{\lambda-685}{25}\right)^2\right]+ \sqrt{\frac{4 \ln 2}{\pi}} \frac{1}{50} \exp \left[-4 \ln 2\left(\frac{\lambda-730}{50}\right)^2\right] $$

The SICF equivalent radiance for $670 < \lambda < 710$ can be calculated as, $L_\mathrm{SICF} = L_\mathrm{\phi}(685) \cdot hc(\lambda)$. Finally the SICF equivalent $r_\mathrm{rs}$ is calculated as, $r_\mathrm{rs,SICF}=\frac {L_\mathrm{SICF}} {E_\mathrm{d}(0^-)}$, where, $E_\mathrm{d}(0^-)$ is the sub-surface downwelling irradiance.The $E_\mathrm{d}(0^-)$ can either be calculated analytically following Gregg & Carder (1990) or from a user supplied file for Spectral water surface irradiance. 

+ $f_\mathrm{DOM}$ affects $\lambda$ between 310-600nm and the spectral shape can be modelled following a log-normal distribution. As the $f_\mathrm{DOM}$ equivalent radiance, $L_\mathrm{fDOM}$ is calculated analytically by integrating a wavelength discretized source scatter function as 

$$\beta_\mathrm{g} (\psi,\lambda^′,\lambda) =   b_\mathrm{g}(\lambda^′)f_\mathrm{g}(\lambda^′, \lambda)\beta_\mathrm{g} (\psi)$$

Where, $b_\mathrm{g}(\lambda^′)$ is loss of photon at excitation wavelength, $\lambda^′$ which is equivalent to $a_\mathrm{CDOM}(\lambda^′)$. $f_\mathrm{g}(\lambda^′, \lambda)$ is the wavelength redistribution function (WRF) calculated as, $f_\mathrm{g}(\lambda^′, \lambda) = \eta_\mathrm{g}(\lambda^′, \lambda) \frac {\lambda^′} {\lambda}$, where, $\eta_\mathrm{g}(\lambda^′, \lambda)$ is the shape of quantum efficiency of $f_\mathrm{DOM}$ modelled after Howes et al. (1992) as 

$$\eta_\mathrm{g}(\lambda^′, \lambda) = A_0\left(\lambda^{\prime}\right) \exp \left[-\left(\frac{\frac{1}{\lambda}-\frac{A_1}{\lambda^{\prime}}-B_1}{0.6\left(\frac{A_2}{\lambda^{\prime}}+B_2\right)}\right)^2\right] $$

Where, $A_0(\lambda^{\prime}), A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2$ are coefficients given by Howes et al. (1992). The phase function is assumed isotropic thus, $\beta_\mathrm{g} (\psi) = \frac {1} {4\pi}$ is set. Finally, the $f_\mathrm{DOM}$ equivalent $r_\mathrm{rs}$ is calculated as, $r_\mathrm{rs,fDOM}=\frac {L_\mathrm{fDOM}} {E_\mathrm{d}(0^-)}$. The $E_\mathrm{d}(0^-)$ is calculated in a similar way to the same for $r_\mathrm{rs,SICF}$.


* INVERSE MODEL

The inverse model is used to retrieve sub-surface $[chl], a_\mathrm{dg}(443)$ and $H, R_\mathrm{B}$ in case of a shallow water column from _in situ_ or Satelite observations of $R_\mathrm{rs}$. The values are obtained by an optimization routine that tries to find the global mimima for the joint distribution of the paramteric space, $\phi_\mathrm{par} : \{[chl], a_\mathrm{dg}(443), H, R_\mathrm{B}\}^{\mathbb{R}^{\lambda_\mathrm{i} \times D}}$. 

In such problems, a cost/objective function, $s_\mathrm{obj}$ is formulated for $\phi_\mathrm{par}$ which is then minimized in an optimization problem. S.A.B.E.R. has two built-in $s_\mathrm{obj}$, i.e. 1. sum-square-of-residuals similar to OLS predictor and 2. sum of log-likelihood of the forward model where the model error is gaussian in nature with a known mean $\mu=0$ but standard deviation $\sigma$ is unknown. For the optimization routines, there are two set of families of optimizer, i.e. 1. gradient based optimization (Box-constraint/Levenberg-Marquardt) and 2. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based sampling. The first type calculates optimal set of parameters by through analytical calculation of the jacobian matrix with respect to the $s_\mathrm{obj}$ and trying to find the point of convergence where the change in hessian matrix becomes flat, i.e. $\frac{\partial{}^2 s_\mathrm{obj}}{\partial{}{[chl]}^2} + \frac{\partial{}^2 s_\mathrm{obj}}{\partial{}{[a_\mathrm{dg}(443)]}^2} + \frac{\partial{}^2 s_\mathrm{obj}}{\partial{}{[H]}^2} + \frac{\partial{}^2 s_\mathrm{obj}}{\partial{}{[R_\mathrm{B}]}^2} = 0$. However, as the inversion of SRTE in optically complex waters is _ill-posed_ problem, gradient-based solutions may tend to retrieve mathematically ambiguous sets of parameters, moreover, such solvers are sensitive to initial values, it can take a long time to reach the global minima or sometimes, it may fail to reach the global minima. To mitigate such problems in inversion of SRTE, an additional probabilistic sampling scheme, MCMC has been integrated in S.A.B.E.R. 

The MCMC framework randomly samples parametric sets following a probabilistic candidate function and compare the quadrature in $s_\mathrm{obj}$. The convergence here in MCMC is diagnosed by reaching _stationary distribution_ for the parametric space. The posterior distribution, which is the joint probability distribution of parameter space, is calculated as: 
$$\mathbb{P}(par|R_\mathrm{rs}) \propto \mathbb{P}(par) \mathbb{P}(R_\mathrm{rs}|par)$$

Where $\mathbb{P}(par)$ is the prior probability of parameters. S.A.B.E.R. is developed with _Weibull_ family of distribution for $[chl], a_\mathrm{dg}(443)$ and $H$ whereas $R_\mathrm{B}$, which is expressed as a linear mixture of fractions of possible bottom class, is assumed to be uniform distribution in nature varying between 0-1. $\mathbb{P}(R_\mathrm{rs}|par)$ is the log-likelihood of the forward model which actually infers the model noise which is found to be Gaussian, thus the log-likelihood can be expressed as:

$$
\log \left(\mathcal{L}\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)\right)=-\frac{n}{2} \log \left(2 \pi \sigma^2\right)-\frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \sum_{i-1}^n\left(x_i-\mu\right)^2
$$

Where, $x_\mathrm{i}$ is the observed $R_\mathrm{rs}$; $R_\mathrm{rs, obs}$ that is input to the inverse problem and $\mu$ is the forward SA.B.E.R. simulated $R_\mathrm{rs}$, The population standard deviation $\sigma$ is usually unknown and also retrieved as a parameter from the inversion.

The MCMC sampling can be performed in a variety of stochastic approaches, S.A.B.E.R. is default with the "Delayed Rejection Metropolis-Hastings" algorithm and a parallel computation of log-likelihood values for a large number, i.e. 10,000 number of iterations. Initial ~2500 iterations are discarded as _"burn-in"_ period prior to ascension to stationarity. Post reaching stationary distribution, _"Maximum-a-Posterior"_ (MAP) estimates; $\theta_\mathrm{MAP} = \underset{par}{\operatorname{argmax}} \mathbb{P}(par|R_\mathrm{rs})$  are obtained as optimal model solutions of $par$, i.e. $[chl], a_\mathrm{dg}(443)$, $H$ and $R_\mathrm{B}$ fractions. The parametric uncertainty is also retrieved from MCMC chains as _"Credible intervals"_. 

Apart from full parametric inversion as described below, an additional retrieval of spectral bottom reflectance;$R_\mathrm{B}(\lambda)$ using algebraic simplification of the AM03 forward model has been included in S.A.B.E.R. However, it is only to be used when the rest of the parameters, i.e. BGC parameters such as $[chl], a_\mathrm{dg}(443)$ or the IOPs and $H$ are known. Moreover, the $R_\mathrm{rs,SICF}$ and $R_\mathrm{rs,fDOM}$ components should be subtracted from the $R_\mathrm{rs, obs}$ prior to input in the following model where $R_{r s}^{obs,e}$ is inelastic component contribution excluded $R_\mathrm{rs, obs}$:

$$ R_B = \frac{R_{r s}^{obs,e}(\lambda) - R_{r s, \infty} \cdot [1 - \exp{(-(K_d + \frac{K_{u,W}}{\cos \theta_v})H)}]}{\exp{(-(K_d + \frac{K_{u,B}}{\cos \theta_v})H)}} $$
