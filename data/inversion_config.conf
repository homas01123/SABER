# 	rrs_type		is the optical type of rrs, can be either "deep" or "shallow"
#   mode      		Mode of inversion, Either "use_grad" (using Bounded Gradient based optimization) or "use_mcmc" (using Bayesian MCMC sampling)
#                   
#   param_name      is the name of parameters to be retrieved from inversion; for optically shallow water; it is c("chl";"adg443";"bbp555";"H";"fa1";"fa2";"fa3";"pop_sd"), for optically deep water; 
# 					it is c("chl";"adg443";"bbp555";"pop_sd")
#
#	min_par			it is the minimum range of values for the inversion to be executed on
#	max_par			it is the maximum range of values for the inversion to be executed on
#	init_par		it is the first guess of initial values for the inversion to be executed on (Not required for MCMC)
#	constrain_conf	it is the selection of parameters for constraining the inversion; c("const_bbp" = F;"const_bgc"=F;"const_IOP"=F)
#	constrain_bbp_val 	it is the value of bbp(555) to constrain the deep water inversion
#	constrain_bgc_val	it is the vector of values to constrain shallow water inversion; c("chl"=4;"adg443"=1;"bbp555"=0.005)
#	constrain_iop	it is the path of absorption and backscatter spectral .csvs to constrain shallow water inversion

#	qaa_mode		it is TRUE or FALSE to run in QAAv6 mode (only for deep water)
#	qaa_prefit		it is TRUE or FALSE if initial values for inversion are fetched from QAA (only for deep waters)
#
#	auto_slope		it is TRUE or FALSE to enable calculation of spectral slope from QAA formulation (only for deep water)
#	manual_slope	it is TRUE or FALSE to enable user-defined spectral slope
#	manual_slope_val 	it is the vector of values for the user defined spectral slopes (only in use when manual_slope is TRUE); c("s_g" (cdom slope) =0.014;"s_d" (detritus slope) =0.003;"gamma" (bbp slope) =0.5)

#	sa_model		it is the selection of paramterization for forward SA model (either "am03" or "lee98")
#	obj_fn			it is the objective function for optimization (either "log-LL" or "obj_L98") (only for "use_grad" mode)
#	opt_method		it is the selection of deterministic method for optimization of "obj_fn" (c("Nelder-Mead";"BFGS";"CG";"L-BFGS-B";"SANN";"Brent";"levenberg-marqardt";"auglag")) (only for "use_grad" mode)

#	iter_count		it is the number of chains to be sampled for MCMC
#	sampler_mcmc	it is the selection of MCMC sampler for the inversion (c("Metropolis", "AM", "DR", "DRAM", "DE", "DEzs", "DREAM", "DREAMzs", "SMC"))
#	hybrid_mode		it is TRUE if MCMC best fit initial values are calculated from "use_grad" mode (only for MCMC and complete unconstrained inversion)

#  NOTE: maintain the order of input vector variables, i.e. param_name, manual_slope_val etc.
